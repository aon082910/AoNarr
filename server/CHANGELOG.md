# Changelog

All notable changes to AoNarr, newest first. See README.md's Verification section for the full
build/test log behind each round.

## Round 17
- Guided first-run onboarding wizard (root folder → indexer → download client checklist)
- SMTP email notifications alongside the existing webhook/bot providers
- Import lists — recurring Trakt/IMDb list auto-add, generalized from the old single Trakt-sync setting
- Audiobooks as a distinct library type
- Public, revocable share links for a single media item's overview/poster
- Per-account TOTP two-factor (household and admin-via-session, not just the legacy API key)
- Docker-secrets-style `_FILE` env vars, plus non-interactive admin account bootstrap
- In-app update checker comparing the running image's build time against Docker Hub

## Round 16
- Multi-instance federation — browse another AoNarr instance's library read-only
- Smart collections — a saved filter re-evaluated live instead of a fixed item list
- Release-group reputation tracking, used as a search tiebreaker
- Bulk edit via CSV upload (the inverse of CSV export)
- Storage quota per root folder, with optional auto-pause of new grabs
- Duplicate request detection for household requests
- Search window scheduling — restrict auto-search to a daily time window
- Media server library validation (AoNarr's library vs. what Plex/Jellyfin/Emby actually reports)

## Round 15
- Plex/Jellyfin/Emby webhook receiver for instant "recently watched" updates
- Self-hosted OpenAPI/Swagger docs page at `/api-docs`
- Download queue manual reordering/priority (qBittorrent, SABnzbd)
- Parental/content rating controls per household user
- Torrent client health stats (seed ratio, upload/download totals, ratio-limit warnings)
- Remote backup destination (S3-compatible: AWS S3, MinIO, Backblaze B2, etc.)
- In-app changelog page (this page)
- Saved/recent searches on Global Search
- Actor/cast browsing pages

## Round 14
- ffprobe media info extraction on import (real codec/resolution/bitrate)
- Automatic failed-grab retry (blocklists the failed release, tries the next-best result)
- FlareSolverr indexer proxy support for Cloudflare-protected indexers
- Import exclusions ("never add this again")
- Custom scripts on grab/import/failure events
- Bulk cleanup suggestions (unmonitored + no file, duplicate-content files)
- Per-user request/storage stats
- Keyboard shortcuts + command palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K)
- Scene-name fallback search

## Round 13
